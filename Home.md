# Overview
Before switching ISPs, I had a public IP that allowed me to use port forwarding on my router to pass traffic to services hosted on my internal network.  My new ISP uses a CGNAT, so I had to find a workaround.  I chose this path, because it keeps pretty much everything the same for my services.  The main things I wanted to do with my setup were:
* Forward only specific traffic from the internet to my services
* Provide my NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) Server with clients real IPs (for fail2ban blocking purposes)
* Allow for traffic to flow to internal services that NPM doesn't manage

I went through a couple configurations and VPS providers before I created this solution.  Prior to attempting this, I had little to no knowledge about VPS providers, wireguard, ufw, and iptables.  Getting it to work the way I wanted took a few days of research, trial, and error.
This will hopefully be a useful tutorial for people who are in a similar situation.  
This tutorial assumes you have some basic knowledge about how to use Ubuntu from the command line.

Here is a basic diagram of my configuration.  The IPs and ports will need to be changed by you to meet your requirements.

![Topology](Basic%20Topology.png)

For reference, here are all the IPs, Ports, and Names that I will be using in this guide for you to reference and change as appropriate.

Name | IP used in tutorial | Port | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
VPS IP | 1.2.3.4 | N/A | Your VPS's IP Address (Assigned to you)
VPS Wireguard IP | 10.0.0.1 | 55107 | The Wireguard IP:Port we will set up in our VPN connection (Created by you)
Nginx IP | 192.168.2.5 | 443 | The Local IP Address of our NPM Server (Should already exist in your local network)
Nginx Wireguard IP | 10.0.0.2 | N/A | The Wireguard IP Address we will use to talk with the VPS Server (Created by you)
Home Assistant IP | 192.168.2.6 | 1234 | The IP:Port of another service that NPM doesn't provide routing for (Should already exist / Home Assistant is just an example)
Synology NAS | 192.168.2.4 | 5001 | The IP:Port of another service that NPM doesn't provide routing for (Should already exist / Synology NAS is just an example)
Docker Server App | 192.168.2.7 | 1194 | The IP:Port of another service that NPM doesn't provide routing for (Should already exist / OpenVPN is an example)

# 1. VPS Setup
I am using [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as my VPS provider.  I tried using Hostinger before since it was cheaper, but since they use OpenVZ for their virtualization, I couldn't get wireguard to work properly on it.  I am using Digital Ocean's cheapest droplet which runs around $6 a month. 
If you want to use Digital Ocean, [here is a tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/) on how to set up a droplet.  I am using Ubuntu 20.04 on mine, but wireguard should work with 18.04 as well.
After you have your droplet set up, you should see the IP of your VPS.  You should use that for all instances you see here of "VPS IP".

***This tutorial will assume you are running Ubuntu 20.04 on both your VPS and Local Server.***

## 1a. Locking down your server
I recommend following a system hardening guide like [this one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-harden-openssh-on-ubuntu-18-04) or [this one](https://medium.com/@jasonrigden/hardening-ssh-1bcb99cd4cef).  After this, I will assume you have kept sshd running on port 22.  If you changed the port, pay attention in the following steps and adjust as appropriate.
## 1b. System config
Enable forwarding by running:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Make sure `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` is not commented, save the file then run:
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```
## 1c. Installing Wireguard
After a `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` run:
```bash
sudo apt install wireguard
sudo (umask 077 && printf "[Interface]\nPrivateKey = " | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf > /dev/null)
sudo wg genkey | sudo tee -a /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf | wg pubkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/publickey
```
Those commands will install wireguard, create a file in `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`, place a generated private key into that file.  Then it prints out a public key **that you need to keep** (if you forget it, the public key is also in the `/etc/wireguard/publickey` file).
Now open the wireguard configuration file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```
### Use the following config:
**Things you need to change:**
Name | Item | Description
--- | --- | ---
*VPS IP* | 1.2.3.4 | The IP Address of your VPS
*interface* | eth0 | Your internet facing interface.

**Things you can change:**

Name | Item | Description
--- | --- | ---
*Wireguard Port* | 55107 | Any unused port you like
*Wireguard Server IP* | 10.0.0.1/24 | Any RFC1918 IP/CIDR.  Don't you your home network's IPs (192.168.2.0/24 in this tutorial).
*Wireguard Host IP* | 10.0.0.2 | Same as above, make sure it's in the same address range.
*Wireguard Host IP/32* | 10.0.0.2/32 | The above IP Address with /32 after it.
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = SHOULD_ALREADY_BE_FILLED_OUT
ListenPort = 55107
Address = 10.0.0.1/24

PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 '!' --dport 22 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 1.2.3.4
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp -i eth0 '!' --dport 55107 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2;

PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 '!' --dport 22 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 1.2.3.4
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p udp -i eth0 '!' --dport 55107 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2;

[Peer]
PublicKey = 
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
```
We will fill in the PublicKey section after we install Wireguard on our local server.

For your inforamtion, the PostUp and PostDown commands will run when wireguard makes/loses connection.
The first PostUp command will forward all TCP traffic (except our SSH traffic on port 22) through the wireguard VPN to our server without changing any of the incomming IP addresses.
The second PostUp command will do the same with UDP traffic (except our wireguard traffic on port 55107).
The PostDown commands just remove what was created with the PostUp commands.

**Note for AWS Users:  I have been told that AWS provides you with both a public and private IP.  They said that in order to get the interface working, you need to use the AWS private IP in the VPS config file.**

# 2. Home Server Setup
## 2a. System config
Enable forwarding by running:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Make sure `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` is uncommented, save the file then run:
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```
## 2b. Installing Wireguard
We're going to do the same installation steps as we did on the VPS.
```bash
sudo apt install wireguard
sudo (umask 077 && printf "[Interface]\nPrivateKey = " | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf > /dev/null)
sudo wg genkey | sudo tee -a /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf | wg pubkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/publickey
```
**Take this public key and place it in the `PublicKey = ` section on the VPS's `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` file.**
Now open the wireguard configuration file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```
### Use the following config:
**Things you need to change:**
Name | Item | Description
--- | --- | ---
*PublicKey* | THE_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_YOUR_VPS_WIREGUARD_INSTALL | The public key you copied when installing wireguard on the **VPS**.

**Things you may have to change:**

Name | Item | Description
--- | --- | ---
*Wireguard Port* | 55107 | The port you used in the VPS config
*Wireguard Host IP* | 10.0.0.2/24 | The Host IP you used in the VPS config with a /24 after it
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = SHOULD_ALREADY_BE_FILLED_OUT
Address = 10.0.0.2/24

PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 1234 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.6:1234; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 1234 -j MASQUERADE
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 5001 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.4:5001; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 5001 -j MASQUERADE
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.7:1194; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j MASQUERADE

PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 1234 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.6:1234; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 1234 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 5001 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.4:5001; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 5001 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.2.7:1194; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -p udp --dport 1194 -j MASQUERADE

[Peer]
PublicKey = THE_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_YOUR_VPS_WIREGUARD_INSTALL
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 1.2.3.4:55107
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```
If all of your traffic just needs to be routed to NPM, then you can delete all of the PostUp and PostDown lines.
Otherwise, you will **need to edit the PostUp and PostDown lines** to suit your needs.  Here is an explanation of the ones I have provided:

Lets say you have Home Assistant running on port 1234 on a different server (IP 192.168.2.6).  You also have a Synology (port 5001) running on a server with the IP 192.168.2.4.  Finally you have an OpenVPN server (port 1194 UDP) running on 192.168.2.7.
 * The first PostUp command will route all (tcp) traffic coming through the VPN on port 1234 to 192.168.2.6
 * The second PostUp command will route all (tcp) traffic from the VPN on port 5001 to 192.168.2.4
 * The third PostUp command will route all (udp) traffic from the VPN on port 1194 to 192.168.2.7

The postDown commands are exactly the same as the PostUp couterparts except that '-A' becomes '-D'.
If you have more services you want to forward traffic to, just add another PostUp command and change the IP address and port as appropriate.  Don't forget to add the similar PostDown command.

# 3. Starting Wireguard
On both the VPS and Local Server, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
```
After you have run both of those commands, test your connection from the VPS:
```bash
ping 10.0.0.2
```
You should see the ping replies.  If you don't please make sure you followed all of the steps and have not received any errors during the installation processes.  Once you have a good connection, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```
on both machines to ensure that wireguard automatically starts.

# 4. Limiting Access
So now, any requests coming into your VPS will be sent to your home server.  

Lets say you only have services running on 443(https for nginx), 1234(Home Assistant), 5001(Synology), and 1194 UDP(OpenVPN).  There is no reason for any other port to be open on your VPS (except 22, and 55107).  So we will use ufw to block all other access.
On your VPS, run the following commands (using your ports):

**Note: If you aren't using 22 as the sshd port, make sure you change the first line to match your port.  If you don't; as soon as you enable ufw, you will be locked out of your VPS**
```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 55107
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 1234/tcp
sudo ufw allow 5001/tcp
sudo ufw allow 1194/udp
sudo default allow routed
sudo default deny incoming
sudo ufw enable
```

On your Local Server, if you have ufw enabled, make sure you open up the same ports as you have on your VPS.  Also be sure to run ```sudo default allow routed```.  If ufw is disabled/not installed, then you don't need to worry.

I recommend installing fail2ban on both your Local Server and your VPS.  The VPS fail2ban will handle your ssh and the one on the local server can handle the others.  That's why I set it up so that all the Original IP addresses are sent through the VPN, so I can still block them.

**Original IP Address Limitations**
While all the traffic coming in to your local server has the original IPs intact, the traffice that is forwarded to our other services via the PostUp iptables command (i.e. Home Assistant, Synology, ...) will have their IPs look like they're coming from your local NPM server.  This wasn't a problem for me since I don't run fail2ban on those extra services.

# 5. Optional Extras
If you want to maintain a more hands off style of administration on your VPS, you can enable unattended upgrades.  Just as the name sounds, this will automatically install security upgrades on your VPS.

Steps:
1. `sudo apt install unattended-upgrades`
2. `sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`
   1. Uncomment the line that contains `"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-updates";` ***should be near the top of the file***
   2. If you want to be emailed when a package is upgraded, or if an error occurs uncomment `Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "your@email.com";` and `Unattended-Upgrade::MailReport "only-on-error";`.  Change the `"only-on-error"` as appropriate.
   3. There are other settings you can change if you like.  For example, you can have the system automatically reboot at a specific time if an update requires it.  Look through the `50unattended-upgrades` file to see what you can enable.
3. `sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades` and replace anything that is already there with:
```
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
```
Those numbers specifiy the number of days between each update/autoclean/download attempt.  Feel free to change as appropriate.

Unattended-upgrades is now installed and configured on your system.

If you would like to test to see if it is working, run:
`sudo unattended-upgrades --dry-run --debug`
You may see a bunch of regexp, but look near the bottom.  There should be a line stating that you have packages that can be upgraded or all your packages are up to date.

Example:
```
Packages blacklist due to conffile prompts: []
No packages found that can be upgraded unattended and no pending auto-removals
The list of kept packages can't be calculated in dry-run mode.
```
You can also check your log files (after a couple days) by running `sudo cat /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log`.

# 6. Troubleshooting

While figuring all this out, I needed to check if traffic was actually getting to my Local Server through the VPN.  I used python's http.server for this.  It sets up a simple web server that you can set to any open port.

I was able to run it from the command line: `sudo python3 -m http.server 443`

Looking back on it though, running that command allows anyone that happens to type in https://YOUR_VPS_IP/ with a page that lists all the files in your directory.  So a more safe test would be to run it in it's own folder with a default index.html page like so:
```bash
mkdir temp_dir
cd temp_dir
echo "Working" > index.html
sudo python3 -m http.server PORT_YOU_WANT_TO_TEST
```
With that web server running, you should be able to go to http://VPS_IP:PORT_YOU_WANT_TO_TEST and see a page that says "Working".  A timeout means that there is some issue with traffic flowing from your VPS to your Local server.  If you see the webpage, you know that the traffic is getting from the VPS to your Local server.  That will at least narrow down your troubleshooting search area.

**Note 1: Make sure the PORT you put in is not being used on your local server already.**

**Note 2: You will need to comment out the PostUp in your local server's wg0.config file and run a `sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0` in order to make sure the iptables rules have been cleared.**


# 7. All Done / References

The last thing you need to do is point your DNS records to the VPS IP.  That is outside the scope of this tutorial.
